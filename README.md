# RoadLib
A lightweight library for instance-level visual road marking extraction, parameterization, mapping, etc.

## What is this? 

This is a enhanced version of our work "Visual Mapping and Localization System Based on Compact Instance-Level Road Markings With Spatial Uncertainty" (RA-L 2022).

Code coming soon... â˜•â˜•â˜•ðŸ™‚
